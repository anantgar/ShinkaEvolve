# Repo-Level ShinkaEvolve Architecture

## Purpose

This document describes the repo-only architecture for ShinkaEvolve: it evolves whole repositories with coding agents while preserving the original evolutionary loop where possible. The artifact boundary changes from one code string to one git-backed repository state.

For the controlled experiment required to support such a comparison, see
[Evaluating Repo-Agent Shinka Against Original Shinka](repo_evolution_evaluation.md).

The upstream baseline is SakanaAI/ShinkaEvolve: https://github.com/SakanaAI/ShinkaEvolve. In that system, individuals are programs, proposal generation asks an LLM for edits to a code string, evaluation runs generated program files, and the database stores program text plus metrics, embeddings, lineage, islands, and metadata. Repo-level ShinkaEvolve should keep the evolutionary algorithm, scheduling model, archive, novelty logic, and metrics flow recognizable. The main change is the individual representation and mutation executor.

## Design Principles

1. Keep the evolutionary loop stable.
   Parent selection, islands, archive behavior, evaluator metrics, novelty scoring, and run bookkeeping should remain close to upstream.

2. Change the artifact boundary, not the whole system.
   The evolved artifact becomes a git commit in a worktree, represented compactly by a summary file. The rest of the system should interact with that artifact through stable interfaces.

3. Agents edit files directly.
   Coding agents such as Codex or Cursor run in a child worktree and modify files there. ShinkaEvolve should not ask agents to emit diffs and should not apply patches to code strings. A worktree isolates lineage and mutation scope; it does not isolate secrets or untrusted code at an operating-system boundary.

4. Summaries represent individuals.
   Each individual must include a compact `summary.md`-style document that captures the mutation idea, changed files, validation, risks, and lineage. The system should embed and compare this summary, not the full repository. The current `.shinka/` summary is an ignored sidecar persisted in the database, not part of the executable Git commit; retain both when reproducing a run.

5. Git is the source of truth for artifacts.
   Each individual should correspond to a commit. The database stores commit identity, summary text, changed files, metrics, and lineage metadata.

6. Evaluation must be isolated from mutation.
   Path policy protects the candidate artifact, but it is not sufficient to protect evaluator secrets. Sealed, private, and adversarial tasks require the secure mutation sandbox and evaluator/candidate process boundary. Trusted-local evaluation is limited to public evaluators and cooperative candidates.

7. Long evaluations are first-class.
   Evaluation may take minutes, hours, or longer. Job state, worktree paths, commits, result locations, and summaries must be persisted enough to recover after process restarts.

## Upstream Baseline

The legacy single-file system had this flow:

1. Load an initial single-file candidate from the legacy config key.
2. Store a `Program` in the database with code, metrics, lineage, and embedding.
3. Sample parent programs from islands and archive state.
4. Build prompts containing current code, prior attempts, evaluator feedback, and inspirations.
5. Ask an LLM to produce a patch, full replacement, crossover, or fix.
6. Apply the generated code to a generated file such as `gen_N/main.py`.
7. Submit an evaluation job with the legacy program-path flag.
8. Read metrics, correctness, and feedback from evaluator output.
9. Store the accepted child program, update islands, update embeddings, and continue.

Repo-level ShinkaEvolve should keep steps 2, 3, 7, 8, and 9 conceptually intact, but replace code-string prompting and patch application with worktree mutation by an agent.

## Repo Individual Model

A repo-level individual should be modeled as:

```text
RepoIndividual
  id
  parent_id
  generation
  island
  repo_path or artifact_uri
  repo_commit
  repo_parent_commit
  changed_files
  repo_summary
  summary_version
  metrics
  correct
  embedding
  logs
  metadata
```

The database continues to call the row model `Program` and table `programs`; it carries repo-specific fields such as `repo_commit` and `repo_summary`. The semantic artifact is no longer a code string. `repo_summary` is the searchable, embeddable individual representation, and `repo_commit` is the reproducible executable artifact.

## Worktree Lifecycle

### Seed setup

1. Validate `seed_repo_path` is a git repository.
2. Resolve `base_ref` to a seed commit.
3. Create a generation 0 worktree from the seed commit.
4. Generate or read the initial summary file.
5. Evaluate the generation 0 repository.
6. Store a database row with the seed commit, summary, metrics, and embedding.

### Child proposal

1. Sample a parent individual from the database.
2. Create a child branch and worktree from `parent.repo_commit`.
3. Write policy/context files into `.shinka/`:
   - mutable paths
   - immutable paths
   - parent id
   - task objective
   - parent summary
   - evaluator feedback
   - archive or inspiration summaries
4. Start a fresh coding-agent session in the child worktree.
5. Ask the agent to mutate only approved paths and update the summary.
6. Validate the worktree before evaluation:
   - the summary exists and matches schema
   - changed files are inside mutable paths
   - immutable paths are untouched
   - symlinks, submodules, generated files, and binary files are policy-compliant
   - the proposal made a real change
7. Commit the child worktree.
8. Embed the summary and optionally run novelty checks.
9. Submit evaluation with `repo_path` and the committed worktree.
10. Persist the completed result with commit, changed files, summary, metrics, logs, and lineage.

## Summary File

The summary file is the compact representation of an individual. The project should standardize one path. The current code mostly points toward `.shinka/individual.md`, while some active paths expect `summary.md`. One path should be chosen and used everywhere.

Recommended default:

```text
.shinka/individual.md
```

Recommended schema:

```markdown
# Individual Summary

Schema-Version: repo-individual-v1

## Parent

## Core Idea

## Lineage Context

## Changed Files

## Validation Performed

## Performance Hypothesis

## Risks and Followups

## Minimal Snippets
```

The summary should:

1. Explain the mutation in natural language.
2. Name the files changed and why.
3. Include only minimal code snippets.
4. State what validation was performed.
5. State the performance hypothesis.
6. Mention risk areas and follow-up ideas.
7. Stay under `summary_max_chars`.

The summary should be embedded for novelty search. It should also be passed to future agents as compact context.

## Agent Session Model

Each proposal should get one fresh agent session tied to one child worktree. That session should remain resumable until the proposal is accepted, rejected, or abandoned.

Required session metadata:

```text
proposal_id
generation
parent_id
worktree_path
agent_provider
agent_model
agent_session_id
prompt_log_path
response_log_path
started_at
completed_at
status
```

The agent provider must honor the requested working directory. A per-call `headless_work_dir` should override any client default. If the underlying CLI supports resume/session ids, store and reuse them for repair prompts. If it does not, retries should still reuse the same worktree and include the transcript or prior failure details.

Concurrency should be per proposal. A global lock around all headless agent calls defeats the purpose of worktree isolation and should only be used for providers that truly require serialization.

## Context Given To Agents

The repo prompt should be built from structured context rather than the old code-string prompt sampler. It should include:

1. Task objective.
2. Evaluator contract.
3. Parent summary.
4. Parent metrics and evaluator feedback.
5. Archive or top-k inspiration summaries.
6. Mutable paths.
7. Immutable paths.
8. Required summary schema.
9. Validation and commit requirements.

The agent should be instructed to edit files directly in the current worktree and produce no patch text for ShinkaEvolve to apply.

## Mutability And Reward-Hacking Controls

Repo-level evolution increases the attack surface. The system should treat path policy as part of the core architecture, not a prompt-only instruction.

Path policy is not a secrecy mechanism. Hiding a path from an agent prompt or making it immutable in a worktree does not protect evaluator repositories, private data, credentials, or result stores from a malicious agent or candidate with host access.

Minimum enforcement:

1. Treat omitted or empty `mutable_paths` as whole-repository mutation. A non-empty list is an explicit user allow-list.
2. Keep evaluation code outside mutable paths.
3. Mark scoring scripts, datasets, expected outputs, `.git`, and `.shinka` as immutable or ignored as appropriate.
4. Check changed files before evaluation and again before commit.
5. Reject changes outside mutable paths.
6. Reject changes to immutable paths even if they also match mutable paths.
7. Reject path traversal, suspicious symlinks, submodule pointer changes, and policy-file edits.
8. Record all changed files in the database.
9. Keep evaluator inputs read-only where practical.
10. Prefer evaluator code outside the evolved repository when benchmarking reward-hacking-sensitive tasks.

Important edge cases:

1. Symlinks inside mutable paths pointing outside the repo.
2. Submodule commit changes.
3. Generated files that affect evaluation.
4. Binary or very large files.
5. Deleted required files.
6. Agents editing dependency lockfiles to avoid real work.
7. Agents modifying benchmark fixtures or cached expected outputs.
8. Ignored files that are consumed by evaluation but not visible in `git diff`.

## Evaluation Contract

Repo-level evaluators should receive a repository path, not a generated program path.

Recommended evaluator CLI:

```bash
python evaluate.py --repo_path /path/to/worktree --results_dir /path/to/results
```

Required outputs:

```text
metrics.json
correct.json
```

Optional outputs:

```text
feedback.txt
logs/
artifacts/
```

The scheduler may keep backward-compatible `program_path` support for upstream-style tasks, but repo mode should submit `repo_path` and run with the worktree as the relevant execution directory.

`evaluation_mode: trusted_local` is this compatibility contract. It is appropriate only for public evaluators and cooperative candidates.

`evaluation_mode: secure` changes the boundary:

1. Normalize and sanitize the candidate into a content-addressed immutable artifact.
2. Run the Headless mutation process in a restricted container, with a proposal-scoped session home mounted only for that proposal chain.
3. Snapshot the mutated candidate as a new immutable artifact.
4. Run candidate code in an isolated runtime while the evaluator, private inputs, scoring logic, job database, and result validation remain trusted-side.
5. Persist launch intent and state before execution, reconcile interrupted jobs on restart, and clean up runtime resources after durable acknowledgement.
6. Publish only allow-listed metrics and bounded public feedback from a schema- and identity-validated result.

The session store persists only an opaque proposal/session identifier, home key, and creation timestamp. Credentials are injected at runtime and are not copied into proposal or result metadata.

For ML inference pipeline tasks, the evaluator should separate correctness, latency, throughput, memory, compile time, and stability. It should warm up models, control seeds, report hardware details, and use repeated measurements to reduce noise.

## Long-Running Evaluation

Long evaluations require durable state. The runner should persist enough information before submitting the job:

```text
job_id
individual_id
generation
parent_id
worktree_path
repo_commit
summary_path
results_dir
submitted_at
status
```

The scheduler should support:

1. Jobs that run much longer than one process lifetime.
2. Restart recovery from pending/running job records.
3. Periodic status polling without fixed short timeouts.
4. Result loading after completion with robust retries.
5. Worktree retention until the database row is safely persisted.
6. Clear failure states for timeout, evaluator error, missing results, and policy violation.

Short fixed timeouts are acceptable for small file reads after a job finishes, but not for the evaluation itself.

## Embeddings And Novelty

Embeddings should be computed from `repo_summary`, not from paths, diffs, or full source trees. The full diff should be stored for audit and reproduction, but novelty should compare compact summaries.

LLM-based novelty checks should also use summaries:

1. Parent summary.
2. Candidate summary.
3. Relevant island or archive summaries.
4. Optional changed-file list.
5. Optional evaluator feedback.

This preserves the original novelty mechanism while making it scale to repositories.

## Database And Archive

The database should keep the original evolutionary concepts:

1. Island membership.
2. Parent lineage.
3. Metrics and score.
4. Correctness.
5. Embeddings.
6. Archive membership.
7. Generation and iteration.
8. Sampling metadata.

Repo-specific fields should be preserved during all operations:

1. Insert.
2. Async insert.
3. Island migration.
4. Island copy.
5. Spawned islands.
6. Best/top-k queries.
7. Resume/recovery.
8. Export.
9. Web UI display.

Compatibility aliases are fine, but no path should silently drop commit, summary, or changed-file fields.

## Module Responsibilities

### `shinka/repo`

Owns worktree creation, path policy, summary schema validation, context rendering, and commit snapshots. It should be the only layer that understands git worktree mechanics.

### `shinka/core/async_runner.py`

Owns orchestration:

1. Initialize seed repo.
2. Sample parents.
3. Create child worktrees.
4. Invoke agents.
5. Validate and commit proposals.
6. Submit evaluation.
7. Persist completed results.
8. Manage async concurrency and shutdown.

It should not contain old code-string patch parsing in the repo proposal path.

### `shinka/llm`

Owns provider invocation. For repo mode, it should expose a reliable agent-call interface with explicit working directory and session metadata. It should not override per-proposal working directories.

### `shinka/database`

Owns persistent individual metadata. It can preserve old names for compatibility, but repo mode must store summary text, commit identity, parent commit, changed files, artifact URI, and mutable policy.

### `shinka/evaluation`

Owns job submission and result loading. It should support both `program_path` for legacy tasks and `repo_path` for repo tasks.

### `shinka/core/novelty_judge.py`

Owns novelty scoring from summaries. It should not depend on generated program paths.

### CLI, docs, examples, and skills

These should teach repo mode directly: seed repository, mutable paths, evaluator contract, summary schema, and agent provider setup.

## Fair Comparison With Upstream

To compare fairly:

1. Keep task objective, evaluator, metrics, population size, island count, archive behavior, and selection logic as close as possible.
2. Change only mutation machinery and artifact representation.
3. Store enough metadata to separate agent improvements from evolutionary algorithm changes.
4. Preserve a pinned upstream branch or checkout for direct comparison; the active ShinkaEvolve path remains repo-only.
5. Report both evaluation metrics and system metrics such as agent tokens, wall time, failed proposals, policy violations, and evaluation cost.

## Current Decisions And Remaining Work

Decided:

1. The summary path is `.shinka/individual.md`.
2. The active system is repo-only; `Program` remains the database term.
3. Secure mode is mandatory for sealed, private, or adversarial evaluation; trusted-local mode is public/cooperative compatibility behavior.
4. Secure proposal continuity uses a durable, proposal-scoped Headless session home and minimal metadata.
5. `mutable_paths` is an allow-list when non-empty; immutable and hidden paths remain policy/prompt-scope controls, not secrecy boundaries.

Still to complete:

1. Publish the universal Headless image and pin its digest.
2. Configure operator credentials and run a small real-agent canary.
3. Run the separately reviewed benchmark experiments; none are part of automated qualification.
4. Define retention and external storage for large diffs, logs, artifacts, and long-running job state.
