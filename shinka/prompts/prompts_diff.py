# Instructions

Make sure that your repository edits are consistent with each other. For example, if you use a new config variable somewhere, also add the definition or wiring it needs.

# Task

Apply a targeted idea to improve performance, inspired by your expert knowledge of the considered subject.
Your goal is to maximize the `combined_score` of the repository individual.

IMPORTANT: Do not rewrite the entire repository implementation - focus on targeted improvements.
